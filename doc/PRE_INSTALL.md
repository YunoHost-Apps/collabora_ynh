If you want to run Collabora on Nextcloud, there is a lightweight version of the Collabora server for ARM, called [Collabora Online - Built-in CODE Server (ARM64)](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/richdocumentscode_arm64) which can easily connect with the [Nextcloud Office](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/richdocuments) app.
